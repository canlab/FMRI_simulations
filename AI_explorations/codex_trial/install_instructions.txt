This example uses OpenAI Codex command line interface to search the web, create a blog post and infographics, and produce a web-ready HTML file with the blog post.

You can imagine creating markdown files for Jupyter books or really anything you want.

1. Install homebrew for Mac (or chocolatey for windows)
2. Install node.js and python if needed

	brew install nodejs python@3.13

3. Install Codex (OpenAI)...or comparable for other models (need paid version probably)

	npm i -g @openai/codex

4. Make a test directory to store files and to which you'll give Codex access:

cd /Users/f003vz1/Downloads
mkdir codex_trial
cd codex_trial

5. Start Codex
	codex

6. Use prompts to read and write files

e.g., 
Strictly follow the recipe in recipe.txt

Style name: Neo-brutalism sticker collage (Gen Z 2025)
Style prompt: Create bold, flat graphics with thick black outlines, chunky drop shadows, off-kilter composition, and sticker-cutout shapes. Use oversized, playful typography, high-contrast blocks, and minimal gradients. Keep it loud, punchy, and a bit chaotic, like a poster made from layered stickers.

Gen Z color scheme: Dopamine brights + soft pastels. Use a high-contrast core of hot pink (#FF3B7F), electric blue (#3B6BFF), neon lime (#B7F000), and sunny yellow (#FFD400), balanced with soft mint (#B8F7E4) and warm cream (#FFF5E8). Use near-black (#111111) for outlines and text.
